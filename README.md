# Big_Int_project
BigInt is a C++ library file that is used to handle very big integers. It can be very useful in calculating very big numbers calculations. It consists of  an inbuilt function  that can be beneficial to use.

# Info
BigNumber is a header-only library for working with integer values bigger than the hardware limit.

BigNumber has no additional dependencies and is as simple to use as possible.

# Arithmetic operators
+ addition:- BigInt operator +(BigInt x);

- subtraction:- BigInt operator -(BigInt x);

* multiplication:- BigInt operator *(BigInt x);

/ division:- BigInt operator /(BigInt x);

% modulus:- BigInt operator %(BigInt x);

# Relational operators
bool operator ==(const BigInt &x) const;

bool operator <(const BigInt &x) const;

bool operator <=(const BigInt &x) const;

bool operator >(const BigInt &x) const;

bool operator >=(const BigInt &x) const;

# Increment and Decrement operators
 BigInt &operator++();

 BigInt &operator--();
